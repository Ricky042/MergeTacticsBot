# MergeTacticsBot By Eric Berg

Welcome to the Merge Tactics Bot repository!
This repository is a documentation of my work in creating a Merge Tactics simulator and a Reinforcement Learning bot to play it

## What you need to do:
- Install requirements
- Customise one of the bots
- Run!
  ```python
  # Edit these or build your own!
  def greedy_bot_logic(player, round_number):
  def efficient_bot_logic(player, round_number):
  def combo_seeker_bot_logic(player, round_number):
  def random_bot_logic(player, round_number):
  ```
